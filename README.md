### NEOVIM
This is a custom neovim config, designed for my persional use.
I do not recommand using it for new beginners.
It may not support all the languages you might need.

It's good to do for Zig, Python and lua development.

### Installation
1. Install neovim by your package manager.
2. clone this repo and rename it to `nvim` in your dots directory.

This command does all that for you
```
git clone https://github.com/santraj611/neovim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
